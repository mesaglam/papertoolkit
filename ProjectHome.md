**Note: Ron graduated from Stanford and is not currently maintaining this project. So it's currently frozen in its mid-2007 state. He'd love to help transfer this project to a new project lead, or advise someone in designing/implementing a PaperToolkit 2.0 from scratch. If you are interested, please email him.**

**Also: You may be interested in the new LiveScribe digital pen (http://www.livescribe.com/) which also provides a Java SDK**

# Description #
This is a toolkit for building applications that integrate pen, paper, and computers. The toolkit leverages Anoto pen technology to provide a next-generation design environment for pen-and-paper interactions.

Although this toolkit is mostly in Java and Flash, it depends on the Anoto SDK, which is built on .NET. Thus, the toolkit does not work on Mac OS X computers, although the individual Java and Flash components can be used or inspected.

# Requirements #
  * Windows XP
  * Windows Vista (if you can get Bluetooth to not BSOD your computer)
  * Java 6
  * Anoto SDK (to work with digital pens, see http://www.anoto.com/)
  * Nokia SU-1B digital pen (also works with other digital pens, but tested mostly with the Nokia)
